# 👋Welcome to My SQL Projects Repository

This space is dedicated to the SQL work I’m building as I grow in data analytics — from data cleaning and feature engineering to deep analytical queries and business-ready insights.

I created this repository as a way to track my progress, practice real-world SQL workflows, and challenge myself to think like an analyst:
not just writing queries, but asking better questions, discovering patterns, and turning data into something meaningful.

Inside this repo, you’ll find:

## 📂 What’s Included

- End-to-end SQL projects (cleaning → preparation → analysis → insights)

- .sql scripts for each stage of the workflow

- Screenshots of results for transparency and learning

- Project notes & interpretations that show how I approach data problems


## What You’ll See in My Work

- Clean, well-structured SQL queries

- Window functions, segmentation logic, and analytical patterns

- A focus on clarity, storytelling, and business understanding

- A genuine enthusiasm for learning and improving 💙


## 🚀 Why I Built This

SQL quickly became one of my favourite tools because of how powerful and expressive it is.
Every project here represents a step in my journey from learning something new, applying it practically, and building the foundation for my data analytics and data science career.

Feel free to explore any folder, run the scripts, or reach out if you’d like to discuss analytics, SQL workflows, or data projects!
