# SQL_Project

## 👋 Welcome!
This repository is my **SQL for Data Analysis** portfolio — where databases turn into insight engines through carefully crafted queries.  
Here, I use SQL to clean, aggregate, and analyse data across multiple scenarios.


## 📂 What’s Inside
- 📜 **SQL scripts (.sql)** – queries for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- 📊 **Sample datasets** – database dumps or CSV files used for testing  
- 📸 **Result snapshots** – screenshots of query outputs and insights  
- 📝 **Project notes** – objectives, thought process, and conclusions

## 🔍 Skills Showcased
- Writing **SELECT** queries with filtering, sorting, and grouping  
- Combining tables with **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and more  
- Aggregating data with **GROUP BY** and aggregate functions  
- Using **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner queries  
- Window functions (**RANK**, **ROW_NUMBER**, **LEAD/LAG**)  
- Data modeling & relational database concepts

## 📊 Example Projects
- **Sales Performance Analysis** – Find top products, sales trends, and customer behavior  
- **HR Analytics** – Employee retention, headcount trends, and payroll analysis  
- **ICT Asset Tracking** – Manage and report on ICT equipment inventory  
- **Maritime Data Insights** – Vessel tracking and compliance reporting

## 💡 My Approach
Every SQL query is a conversation with the database — I focus on **clarity, efficiency, and reusability** so insights are easy to obtain and share.

## 🚀 How to Explore
1. Open any `.sql` file in your preferred SQL editor (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).  
2. Connect to the relevant dataset or database.  
3. Run the queries step-by-step to explore the analysis.

## 🖤 Final Note
Whether you’re learning SQL or looking for analysis templates,  
these projects are designed to be clear, practical, and adaptable.  
Data has answers — SQL is how we ask the right questions.
